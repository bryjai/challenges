# Bryj.ai DevOps/SRE Challenge - Part 3 - Making an API
 
Now it's time to expose an HTTP API that, given a country ISO code and a date, returns the amount of requests handled by that location on that given day.

Input:
* Country ISO Code
* Date

Expected output:

```json
{
    "country": "FRA",
    "date": "2019-08-26",
    "count": "1234"
}
```

The API path is up to you.

You're almost there! The Part 4 is waiting for you.
